# Campus-WebGIS
Final Updated on 2018.6
This is a campus web GIS project with MVC structure, supported by OpenLayer in the frontend, ArcServer/Servlet server in backend and PostGIS in database.
In this project, you can not only visualize and navigate your campus from shapefile data in database, but you can personalize the map as you want: it is super convenient to personalize the map. The front end and backend are synchronized. You can easily edit map data on frontend and the backend will be changed at the same time. 
You can easily see the important introduction information in every point of interest, this is achieved by spatial query. You can also upload your building photo to database: this is enabled by using binary string communication.
Too hard to conclude a project inclusively only by words! Please watch my Youtube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoUfgVeRRHs&t=59s and read my source code to navigate my campus!
